#Mansi and Karun's Wedding website template
####by [Karun Japhet](https://karun.me)

Free wedding templates are hard to find and since I needed one, I decided to use my rather terrible web designing skills to make one.

While I'm at it, why not
 
* make it available for free?
* use bootstrap and other frameworks/utils for coolness?
* create a grunt config to auto-build and deploy?
* use Less instead of writing CSS?
* minify all HTML, CSS and JS?
* compress all images during deployment?

So I ended up doing all of that which is why this project is quite (unnecessarily) bigger than it probably should be.

## Grunt Commands

* ``grunt`` - cleans and builds
* ``grunt serve`` - start server and watch resources for changes. hot deploys them to reduce feedback cycle.
* ``grunt deploy`` - Deploys your code to the remote server
